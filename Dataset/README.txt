Problem Statement :-

    E-commerce is all about the combination of, 
    a plethora of products available in the market and the customers who purchase them. 
    It would be difficult to manage the information about these colossal market data just using excel. 
    Such a humongous amount of data needs a defined and structured storing approach, 
    to keep a track of various market activities that would be happening on a day-to-day basis. 
    This can be done using database systems, as it is efficient enough to store the data, 
    manipulate them as per needs and can be used for analyzing the market trends as per needs.
